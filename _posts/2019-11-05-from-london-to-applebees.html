<p><em>This post requires a little bit of context.  At the end of 2019 my wife and I were preparing to move back to the USA after more than two years living and working in central London.  It was a very fun and educational time with lots of travel, but there were cultural things I missed back in the USA.  I wrote the following missive and shared with a thousand strong social media group of American ex-pats.  If you have ever lived or worked in Europe I would hope you could recognize the humorous contrast, or otherwise enjoy how much fun a trip to Applebees actually is...</em></p>


<p>I’m an American who has been living abroad in London for the past 10 months.&nbsp; There are some things I really miss.&nbsp; But this is why I love to travel: because while you’re learning about your destination, you’re also learning about where you came from.</p>


<p>I’m looking forward to being home.&nbsp; I still am enjoying my time abroad, but there are things I will certainly cherish when I get home.</p>


<p>I want to share a story of how I want my first Friday to go when I get back Stateside.&nbsp; I want to do something so ordinary, and just enjoy it because the following simply isn’t possible in Europe.</p>


<p>I want to go to Applebees.</p>


<p>I’ll drive my car into the dedicated parking lot, and find a spot that is astronomically wide.</p>


<p>As I walk through the front door, I am enveloped by the aroma of hamburger.&nbsp; I will be greeted by a high-school aged host/ess with a huge amount of cheerfulness and acne.&nbsp; Directly behind said hostess will be an employee in training awkwardly trying not to be awkward.</p>


<p>My friends and I shall be seated in a booth with seat backs that are six feet tall, and I will sit down and sink a full five inches into the cushioning.</p>


<p>The menus will already be at the table, filed neatly behind the salt and pepper shakers.&nbsp; But before I can reach for the menu, a bus-person brings a 40 oz plastic cup of iced water, and leaves me with a giant straw, and then drops four spare straws on the table just-in-case.</p>


<p>The menus are opened, and they contain more pictures than words.&nbsp; I don’t need to try to visualize what is offered by the menu, the pictures do that for me.&nbsp; Every word on the menu is in English.</p>


<p>The waiter/waitress arrives and as I order my burger, I am delightfully informed that I can substitute sweet potato fries, and I will accept the offer.&nbsp; Guacamole will only be $1 extra, and I will take that as well.</p>


<p>The waiter rushes away with our order.&nbsp; Suddenly five other wait staff members emerge from the kitchen, all clapping in unison.&nbsp; Hooting and hollering they proceed to the table next to my booth, and surround one of the guests.&nbsp; A baritone and multi-tune rendition of “The Happy Birthday Song” is sung.&nbsp; Not “Happy Birthday” because that’s still under copyright and Applebees’ lawyers have wisely sidestepped that liability.&nbsp; And as an American, I greatly appreciate that legal distinction and make comments about it to the rest of the people at my table.</p>


<p>Beer arrives within 67 seconds, served in a super-chilled mug that causes some of the water content to freeze on the surface.&nbsp; Someone at the table will assuredly remark that the freezing temperature of alcohol is “actually wicked lower than when water freezes.”&nbsp; (This Applebees is located in Massachusetts.)</p>


<p>My burger arrives, and I know it’s mine and with the correct temperature because stuck in the top of the bun is a color coded toothpick.&nbsp; Only now is the full design of the booth appreciated.&nbsp; After initially sliding and sinking into said booth, the level of the table is perfect so that one can place forearms against the edge of the table, hold a burger, gently lean in, and form a perfect triangle with torso, arms &amp; table so that the burger hovers over the plate and catches all over-spilling condiments and toppings.</p>


<p>The waiter will perform two perfectly timed flybys of the table to ask how things are going.&nbsp; (Both times, my mouth will be full and mid-chew, but a quick glance and a sigh will convey the message.)&nbsp; The ketchup bottle is empty but a new one appears within 9.4 seconds.&nbsp; Usain Bolt ran 100 meters in a lethargic 9.58 seconds.</p>


<p>Plates are cleared as soon as we finish, and my forearms can now stretch out across the table as I lean back.&nbsp; I sink even further into the booth’s cushioning, achieving post-meal Stage 2 depth.</p>


<p>“Would you like some dessert?”&nbsp; It’s the most delightful upsell attempt, but the answer is always ‘no’ and the next step in the protocol will be “I’ll get your check right away.”&nbsp; Note, to get the check I did not have to do any of the following (as one might do in Europe): sit idly for 2 hours, chase down the waiter at the other end of the restaurant, or stay past the closing time of the restaurant.</p>


<p>Credit cards are swiped, and I’m back on my feet no more than 36 minutes after I first sank into the booth for the meal.&nbsp; The question: where besides the USA can you do a sit-down meal in half an hour?&nbsp; The correct answer is not France.</p>


<p>The food portions were just a little bit more than I needed, and as a result it’s a relaxed and careful walking pace as we make our way out the front door.&nbsp; An utmost attempt is made to avoid eye-contact with the dozen people waiting for a table, who are murderously envious of our condition.</p>


<p>Outside, it’s sunny, and hot.&nbsp; Probably really hot and humid.&nbsp; The car is two first-downs away from the restaurant front door, while walking it’s just enough time to situate your sunglasses on the bridge of your nose and run your hand through your hair.&nbsp; We slide into the car, which is an oven, but one minute later we’re bathed in Air Conditioning powered by a large V6 engine.</p>


<p>I pop the car into ‘D’ for Drive, glide out of the parking lot, and make a right onto Main Street and half a mile later merge onto the highway.&nbsp; Then it’s 70 mph all the way home.</p>


<p>I love America.</p>
