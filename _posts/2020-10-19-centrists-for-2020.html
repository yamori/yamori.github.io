<p>I just voted.</p>


<p>When I was hanging the American flag in our living room this summer, I had a hard time deciding how to center it as we have an irregular fireplace. Do I align it by the brick, mantle, sconces, ceiling beams?… There were many choices I could use to achieve the balance for my display, even though it was at maximum a matter of 6" horizontal distance.</p>


<p>(At this point I'm sure you are anticipating the political metaphor.)</p>


<p>The US is a very polarizing political scene. Binary. Blue or red. Populism (on both ends of the spectrum) devolves into volume and not enough substance. The level of partisan politics in Congress is very high, as evidenced by the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/04/23/a-stunning-visualization-of-our-divided-congress/">diminishing cross-aisle legislation</a> being passed.</p>


<p>But there’s the center. A whole bunch of us moderates that just want bipartisan efforts in making the Executive + Legislative branches productive to run the country. Professionalism and cooperation among politicians! Maybe one day we’ll have three, four, or even five major presidential candidates that enter the race knowing they will never enjoy the effects of majority politics. But for this election there are two major candidates.</p>


<p>My vote was for the person whom I believe has the best chance of bridging the aisle, and the morality + character to steward four inspiring years of Executive branch leadership.</p>


<p>Being a centrist is not no wo/man’s land.  In fact it's more important than ever.  “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/opinion/tony-blair-against-populism-the-center-must-hold.html?_r=0">The center must hold</a>” (Tony Blair).</p>
