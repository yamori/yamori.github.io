Britishized

Nike
Just do it
Say 'sorted' sooner

Apple
Think different
Mind other potentially revealing perspectives

KFC
It's finger lickin good
So tasteful your fingers will be improperly dirty

Coca cola
Open happiness
After opening, feel fresher

McDonald's
I'm loving it
Difficult to detest

Dunkin donuts
America runs on dunkin
The Yanks have moved off from tea to Dunkins

Autozone
Get in the zone
Be immersed and focused with your auto

Aflac (supplemental health insurance)
Ask about it at work
You already have NHS

Quest diagnostics
The patient comes first
First the Queen, then wherever the patient is in queue.

Home depot
More saving. More doing.
Be efficient with both money and efforts

Tractor supply company
For life out here
For the Cotswolds or even further...

Wells Fargo 
Together we'll go far
Banking so proper you won't want to try anywhere else.

Americanized

BT (British Telecom)
It’s good to talk
Never miss an important post, DM, or stream, ever

Tesco (super and express markets)
Every little helps
Everything to help you through anything

British Airways
The world’s favorite airline
The best airline in the universe

Marks & Spencer (grocer and department store)
The customer is always and completely right
We promise you won’t go wrong

Vodafone
Make the most now
Grab life and do your thing

Jaguar
Own a Jaguar at a price of a car
Get in a Jag now, we’ll figure out the financing (subject to terms and conditions, assuming an 84 month lease, medium-good credit score, and variable interest financing adjusting every 39 days but not to exceed 200 basis points movement or fall below the predominant Greek 10 years bond rate whichever is higher, subject to cancellation and not available in the state of Idaho, Florida, or Reno Nevada due to ongoing litigation)
