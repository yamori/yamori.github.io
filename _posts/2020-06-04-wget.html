<p>WGET, an indispensable tool for working with the web.  Below are a few examples extracted from my CLI cheat-sheet, with explanation on syntax.</p>


<h3>WGET &amp; CURL: equivalent examples</h3>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>wget -O index.html www.exampledomain.com

# The -O (upper case) is optional, and if omitted it usually saves as the index.html for the website.</code></pre>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>curl -L www.exampledomain.com &gt; index.html

# The -L follows all redirects before returning data.
# Curl normally spits out to the CLI, but the '&gt;' redirects the named file.  Beware '&gt;' overwrites, sometimes useful is '&gt;&gt;' to append.</code></pre>
<p><!-- /wp:code --></p>

<h3>Debugging</h3>
<p>Sometimes it's really useful to be able to grab a website in its entirety.</p>
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">wget -pHk www.exampledomain.com

<strong>-p</strong>  fetches all accompanying assets (images, css, js) to view the site
<strong>-H</strong>  enables recursive run, to fetch assets from other hosts
<strong>-k</strong>  after downloading, this will change all asset links to local/relative</pre>
<p><!-- /wp:preformatted --></p>

<h3>Extra</h3>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>du -sh $pwd</code></pre>
<p>After a <code>wget -pHk</code> (in an empty directory), use <code>du -sh $pwd</code> to see the size of your website.  I've found this to be a good statistic to keep track of for UX/mobile purposes.  Though there's a lot to consider whether it's CSS, JS, or other and a large website doesn't necessarily mean it's slow.</p>
