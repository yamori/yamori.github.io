<p>Almost ten years into IT/software consulting has taught me how to stay mindful, <a href="https://kk.org/thetechnium/68-bits-of-unsolicited-advice/">enthusiastic</a>, and maintain perspective.  I was in my backyard and happened upon an analogy with some <a href="https://www.almanac.com/plant/morning-glories">morning glories</a> I'm trying to grow.</p>

<p><strong>Not</strong>: "What am I doing here?  How did I get myself stuck here, all by myself..."<br /><strong>Rather</strong>: "Let me learn all I can about the space I'm in.  I'm sure there's more to learn and I'm sure someone else would find my insights &amp; experience valuable."</p>

<p><strong>Not</strong>: "Look at everything I have to keep track of, all the loose ends I left behind, and the crap I'll probably have to deal with again at some point."<br /><strong>Rather</strong>: "I made it to where I am not just because of my successes, but also from the failures and having learned from them.  I can extract confidence from either type of outcome, and this is my inner portfolio."</p>

<p><strong>Not</strong>: "It's all just one soul-sucking climb that never ends."<br /><strong>Rather</strong>: "The future me may have different goals, let me chew off what I think I can do today, this week, this month, and this quarter.  I know people will recognize and respect that I'm trying to build towards a larger goal even if I'm not 100% sure where or what it is."</p>
