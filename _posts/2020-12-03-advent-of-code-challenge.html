<p>It's important to continually hone your own skills true to being a true profesional.  Credit to my colleague <a href="https://davidlozzi.com/">David Lozzi</a> for bringing <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code 2020</a> to my attention, to which I immediately knew I had to partake.</p>

<p>Daily coding challenges are posted while the site interweaves some stats, socialization, and leaderboards.  My personal goals:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Complete all 25 challenges</li>
    <li>Try a new language for at least one challenge</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, the <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/3">Day 3</a> challenge: 'ski' down a grid thousands of lines long and count the number of trees encountered for a specified slope...</p>

<p>Please check out <a href="https://github.com/yamori/advent_of_code_2020">my solutions on GitHub</a> (all JS so far) or follow along.  After only three days I've already found it incredible revealing to see how my fellow <a href="https://www.slalom.com/locations/boston">Slalom</a> colleagues have solved the same problem with different languages, approaches, and personal coding style.</p>

<p>Happy Coding!</p>
<p>Merry Christmas!</p>
<p>Happy New Year!</p>
