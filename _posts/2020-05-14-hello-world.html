<p>After reading and benefiting from so many peoples' cool blogs, I decided I wanted to have fun too.</p>


<p>I'm a Software Consultant, love talking about technology, and have wide interests outside of work (because I'm human).</p>


<p>To start my blog, I first started building a tech stack to host my blog.  I was armpit deep in standing up a <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a> app, connected to a github repo, using an EC2 instance to build, then deploy to S3 where I could then CloudFront, then buy a cert in ACM to front and then use Rt 53... blah.</p>


<p>I just want to blog, man.  I know I have hated on Wordpress before.  Credit card swiped and I have a personal account for a year, and my own domain!</p>


<p>Hello World!</p>
